About FTC Team 479

We are one of the Stuy Fusion 479, one of the FTC teams in Stuyvesant High School, NYC. We participate in the First Tech Challenge, while trying to help spread STEM, as well. We help promote confidence, hard-work, and persistence, qualities that will make the members of our team, the best that they can be.
